# DUK Map 🌴 

This is a small project I made for 'Just Build' event in **Digital University Kerala (DUK).** 
It is a prototype interactive map where you can search rooms and related info and see them highlighted.  

## Features  
- **Search Bar** → type a room no., the room gets highlighted, along with info about room no., professor, faculty, email and description. 
- **Highlight Animation** → the searched room blinks so it is easy to notice.  
- **Hover Effect** → when you hover, rooms glow.  
- **Badges Page** → small extra page to show how one can earn fun badges (just for fun).

## Current Status  
- Only **Ground Floor** is made. I could not complete other 3 floors because of limited time.  
- The site is **not responsive**, so please view it only on **PC/Laptop**.  
- Basic version only, not much design polish.  

## Note  
I know I could have done much better, but I didn’t have enough time.  
If this idea looks useful and people want me to continue, then I will need help from someone good at web development, so we can complete all floors properly.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vimal-Mudalagi/DUK-MAP.git
2. Open the project folder.
3. Just open `index.html` in your browser.
